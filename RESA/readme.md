### RESA Simulation

- Requires three files: **label file (.lbl)**, **bit file (.bit)**, and the **.COD file** generated by the assembler (`asm.c`).  
- The **label file** defines memory address mappings used by RESA.  
- The **bit file** configures the FPGA design of the DLX + SHARPEN processor (generated from `/RTL` with Xilinx ISE).  
- The **.COD file** is produced by compiling and running `asm.c` on assembly programs in `/Assembly Files`.  
- To create a `.COD` file, build and run the assembler:  
  ```bash
  gcc asm.c -o asm
  ./asm sharpen_test.txt

-	In RESA, load the label file, bit file, and the generated .COD file.
-	Run the simulation to execute your program on the extended DLX processor.
-	Verify results by comparing RESA outputs with the PGM/CSV files generated by the C reference program in /C Files.
